## Programming Assignment 3b for COT 4500: Numerical Methods

This repository contains implementations of numerical methods for focusing on Gaussian elimination, LU factorization, and matrix properties.

### Required Libraries
- Before running the code, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can find these libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Running the Code
- To use the `assignment_3.py`, navigate to the `src/main` directory and run:
    python assignment_3.py
    

- To run the tests in `test_assignment_3.py`, navigate to the `src/test` directory and execute:
    python -m unittest test_assignment_3
    
    This command will run all the test cases in `test_assignment_3.py` to verify the functions implemented in `assignment_3.py`.
